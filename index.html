                            have heard some people who had an amazing experience
                            here. I signed up for the free intro course and
                            found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly
                            thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and
                            most grueling - time of my life. Since completing
                            the course, I’ve successfully switched careers,
                            working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

                            “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a
                            line of code. I needed some structure from
                            professionals who can help me learn programming step
                            by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
                            student of theirs who can only say wonderful things
                            about the program. The entire curriculum and staff
                            did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I
                            never had to wait long for assistance. The agile
                            team project, in particular, was outstanding. It
                            took my learning to the next level in a way that no
                            tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often
                            referred to it during interviews as an example of my
                            developent experience. It certainly helped me land a
                            job as a full-stack developer after receiving
                            multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
